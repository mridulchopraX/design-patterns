# Design Patterns

## Overview

Design patterns are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems that occur during software design. They are not specific to a programming language but provide a template on how to solve issues in various situations. Using design patterns can help make your code more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.

This repository contains examples of common design patterns used in software development. Each pattern is implemented with sample code to demonstrate how it can be applied.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Reusability**: Design patterns allow you to reuse solutions that have been proven to work.
- **Scalability**: Patterns are designed to handle changes and growth in the system without breaking existing code.
- **Maintainability**: By using a design pattern, you make your code easier to maintain and understand.
- **Best Practices**: These patterns promote using best practices in coding and architecture, helping you avoid common pitfalls.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are broadly categorized into three groups:

### 1. Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Allows you to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object (prototype).
- **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### 2. Structural Patterns
Structural patterns deal with the composition of objects and classes to form larger structures.

- **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect, allowing classes to work together that wouldn’t otherwise be able to.
- **Bridge**: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, offering a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or frameworks.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory consumption by sharing as much data as possible between similar objects.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing each handler to either handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
- **Interpreter**: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.
- **Mediator**: Reduces coupling between classes by making them communicate through a mediator object instead of directly.
- **Memento**: Allows capturing and restoring an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to redefine specific steps without changing its structure.
- **Visitor**: Allows adding further operations to objects without modifying them.
