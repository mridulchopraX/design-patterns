# Builder Pattern
## Overview
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that helps in constructing complex objects step by step. It allows the creation of different representations of an object using the same construction process. The main idea behind the Builder Pattern is to separate the construction of an object from its representation, allowing greater control and flexibility over how the object is constructed.

This pattern is particularly useful when a complex object contains multiple fields, some of which are optional, or when you want to create different variations of an object using a similar construction process.

## Problem
In scenarios where an object needs to be constructed in multiple steps and involves many fields, managing object creation becomes cumbersome and error-prone. The constructor for such objects can become overloaded with parameters, many of which might be optional or only required in specific configurations.

For example, imagine constructing a House object with multiple attributes like foundation, walls, roof, windows, doors, and more. Each attribute might have several variations, and some of these attributes might not always be required.

Using a simple constructor or multiple setters to build such an object can lead to confusing and less maintainable code.

## Solution
The Builder Pattern addresses this issue by providing a flexible solution that allows complex objects to be built incrementally. This pattern divides object creation into smaller, manageable steps, where each step adds a piece to the final object.

## Key Components of the Builder Pattern:
1. **Builder**: Defines the interface or abstract class with methods to construct parts of the object.
2. **Concrete Builder**: Implements the builder interface, defining the specific steps required to create the object.
3. **Director**: Controls the construction process using the builder and determines the final product configuration.
4. **Product**: The complex object that is constructed step-by-step.

+-------------------+      +-------------------+
|     Director      | ---> |     Builder        |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+
                               /\
                              /  \
                       +-------------------+      +-------------------+
                       |  Concrete Builder | ---> |     Product        |
                       +-------------------+      +-------------------+

## Advantages of the Builder Pattern
* **Separation of Construction and Representation**: It separates the process of constructing an object from its final representation, allowing different object representations using the same construction process.
* **Flexibility**: The construction process is flexible, allowing optional fields and various configurations of the final object.
* **Readability**: It makes the code more readable and manageable, especially when building objects with many optional parameters.
* **Reusability**: The same construction logic can be reused for different object configurations.

## Disadvantages
* **Complexity**: Introducing the Builder Pattern may add unnecessary complexity for simpler objects that don't require step-by-step construction.
* **Overhead**: Creating a separate builder class for every object might introduce additional overhead if not required for simpler objects.

## When to Use the Builder Pattern
* When you need to construct an object with many optional fields or parameters.
* When you want to separate the construction of an object from its representation.
* When you want to build different variations of the same object.
* When the construction process needs to be more controlled and consistent.
