# Prototype Pattern
## Overview
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying or cloning existing objects, rather than instantiating new ones. This is particularly useful when the process of creating an object is expensive or complex. The prototype pattern allows you to efficiently create duplicates of an object, retaining its internal structure and state.

In the Prototype Pattern, objects are created through cloning rather than through direct instantiation. This is useful when you want to avoid the overhead of re-creating an object from scratch and instead need a copy of an already existing object.

## Problem
Imagine you have a complex object with many attributes, and creating an instance of that object is time-consuming or resource-intensive. Instead of recreating it from scratch every time, you can create a prototype and clone it, making a copy with all the attributes already set up.

This pattern can also be useful in situations where you need multiple instances of an object with slightly different configurations, and you want to reuse the configuration of a base object.

## Solution
The Prototype Pattern solves this problem by:

* Defining a prototype object with the base attributes.
* Allowing new objects to be created by cloning or copying the prototype.

## Key Components of the Prototype Pattern:
1. **Prototype Interface**: This defines the method for cloning objects. Usually, this is a clone() method.
2. **Concrete Prototype**: These are the actual objects that can be cloned. Each concrete class implements the cloning method.
3. **Client**: The client can create new objects by cloning the prototype instead of instantiating new objects directly.

## Structure
```plaintext
+--------------------+     +----------------------+
|   Prototype        | <---| Concrete Prototype   |
| - clone()          |     | - clone()            |
+--------------------+     +----------------------+
         ^
         |
+--------------------+
|       Client       |
+--------------------+

```

## Workflow:
1. The **Client** requests a new object by cloning an existing **Concrete Prototype**.
2. The **Concrete Prototype** implements the _clone()_ method to create a duplicate of itself.
3. New objects are created without calling the constructor but by duplicating existing objects.

## Real-World Use Cases
1. **Game Development**: In video games, if you need to create multiple enemies or objects with the same properties but minor variations (such as size, color, or strength), the prototype pattern can be used to clone existing entities instead of creating them from scratch.
2. **Document Management**: When working with document templates (such as invoices, reports, or resumes), you can create a prototype document and clone it to produce new versions without modifying the original template.
3. **Configuration Objects**: In complex systems where configuration setup is resource-intensive, creating a prototype with the initial configuration and cloning it for multiple instances can save time and resources.

## Advantages of the Prototype Pattern
1. **Efficient Object Creation**: When the cost of creating new objects is high, cloning existing objects is much more efficient.
2. **Avoids Subclassing**: Instead of using subclasses to define different object configurations, you can create prototypes and modify them as needed.
3. **Reduces Complexity**: The prototype pattern simplifies object creation and reduces the need to instantiate objects manually, particularly for complex or expensive objects.
4. **Dynamic Object Creation**: Prototypes allow for dynamic creation of objects during runtime, rather than relying on class definitions.

## Disadvantages
1. **Shallow vs. Deep Copy**: Cloning can be tricky when an object has complex attributes (e.g., references to other objects). The difference between shallow and deep copy becomes important, and deep copy might not always be straightforward.
2. **Copying Complexity**: If the objects are too complex, it may become challenging to ensure all dependencies are properly copied during the cloning process.
3. **Hidden Dependencies**: Since the Prototype Pattern involves cloning, there is a risk that hidden dependencies from the original object may carry over into the cloned objects.

## When to Use the Prototype Pattern
* When the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than cloning an existing one.
* When you need to avoid subclasses to create different configurations of an object.
* When you need to create objects dynamically during runtime.
* When object creation needs to be decoupled from the objectâ€™s behavior.
