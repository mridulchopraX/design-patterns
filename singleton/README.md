# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The **Singleton Design Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance, and it provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system, such as when managing access to shared resources (e.g., configuration settings, logging, or database connections).

In the Singleton pattern, the class itself is responsible for ensuring that only one instance is created, typically by hiding its constructor and providing a static method for retrieving the sole instance.

## Why Use Singleton?

- **Controlled Access to a Single Instance**: Singleton restricts the instantiation of a class to one object, preventing the creation of multiple instances and ensuring consistent behavior across the system.
- **Global State**: Provides a way to maintain a global state or resource that is accessible from anywhere within the application.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Singletons can defer object creation until itâ€™s actually needed, which can improve performance when dealing with expensive resources.

## Key Characteristics of Singleton

- **Private Constructor**: Prevents external classes from instantiating the Singleton class directly.
- **Static Method**: Provides a global access point for retrieving the singleton instance.
- **Lazy Initialization (Optional)**: The instance is created only when it's first requested, avoiding unnecessary memory use.
- **Thread Safety (Optional)**: In multithreaded environments, thread safety must be ensured to avoid creating multiple instances.

## Structure

```plaintext
+----------------+
|   Singleton     |
+----------------+
| - instance      |  // A static instance of the class (usually private)
+----------------+
| + getInstance() |  // A public static method to access the instance
+----------------+
